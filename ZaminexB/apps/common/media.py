"""Serve uploaded media only to authenticated users who may access it.

The media root contains consultant avatars, property images and property
appraisal PDFs. The previous implementation only checked authentication, which
let any logged-in consultant download every uploaded file by guessing its name.
This module adds:

* path traversal protection (``..`` and absolute paths are rejected);
* per-entity checks with the following access boundary:

  * **property images** — any *authenticated* user. They are part of the
    property read model: every consultant can read every property (the
    «همه املاک» ``scope=all`` view and the detail page), and the list/detail
    serializers already hand out these exact URLs — so the media endpoint
    must serve them, or the delivered URL 403s for a non-owner.
  * **appraisal PDFs** (``properties/appraisals/…``) — admin, the assigned
    consultant, or anyone while the property is shared. These are sensitive
    documents, so they stay owner/shared only.
  * **consultant avatars** (``consultants/…``) — the consultant's own avatar
    only; other consultants' profile photos are not exposed to non-admins.
  * **admin avatars** (``admins/…``) — never exposed to consultants.
  * any other path — denied by default.
